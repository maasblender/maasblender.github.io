title: Execution on local machine
---

We present an example of running a simulation on a local machine (e.g., your laptop).
In this example, we simulate Mobility as a Service (MaaS), which consists of the following mobility services:


| Type | Overview | Input Data |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Scheduled | A service with fixed routes and timetables (e.g., trains and buses) | GTFS |
| On-demand | A service operated based on customer requests | GTFS-Flex |
