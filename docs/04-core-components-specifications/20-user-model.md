title: "User Model"

This chapter specifies the reference implementations for User Model components in MaaS Blender.
The User Model represents the decision-making logic of individual users throughout their journey.
It orchestrates trip planning, route selection, reservation, and execution by coordinating with planners and mobility services through event-driven interactions.

The project currently ships two reference implementations under `maasblender/src/user_model`:
- Simple User Model: for straightforward route selection with basic preference handling.
- Favorite-based User Model: for more sophisticated per-user preferences including favorite services and sorting criteria.

Both implementations share the same event contract and lifecycle but differ in route-selection policies and configuration options.

### Common Lifecycle

All User Model implementations follow this general flow:

1. The simulator forwards a `DEMAND` to the User Model via `UserManager.demand(...)`.
2. The manager calls an external route planner (`Planner`) with `plan(org, dst, dept)`.
3. The User Model ranks/filters candidates according to its selection policy (varies by implementation).
4. The selected route is converted into a sequence of tasks (`Reserve`, `Trip`, `Wait`).
5. The `User` entity runs the tasks in order, emitting `RESERVE` and/or `DEPART` at appropriate times.
6. On `RESERVED` failure, the User Model switches to a recovery task sequence (fallback to alternative plan or walking).
7. The User Model continues to observe `DEPARTED` and `ARRIVED` to orchestrate transfers and detect leg completion.

## Simple User Model

- Files: `user_model/simple/`
- Primary class: `UserManager`

This model provides a user decision policy with a small set of preferences.

### Behavior

- Calls `Planner.plan(org, dst, dept)` to retrieve route candidates.
- If the `DEMAND` provides `service`, applies preference mode:
  - `PreferenceMode.fixed`: keeps only plans that contain the specified service.
  - Otherwise: sorts so that plans containing the service come first.
- If only 1 plan is returned, builds tasks for that plan with walking fallback for mobility legs.
- If 2+ plans are returned, builds a primary sequence and sets the secondary as recovery; recovery is used if the primary mobility leg fails.
- If a route pattern matches "reservation-required" (heuristic: 3-trip route with the middle leg's `service` in `confirmed_services`), the manager builds a `Reserve` task for that leg. Otherwise, legs are built as direct `Trip` tasks (e.g., walking or services without reservations).
- If `dept > now` and the first task is a `Trip`, a `Wait(dept)` task is inserted before the first leg.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "preference_mode": "fixed",                   // or any other value for prefer mode
  "confirmed_services": ["taxi", "bus"]         // services that require reservation
}
```

- `preference_mode` (from `jschema.query.PreferenceMode`):
  - `"fixed"`: filters plans to only those that include the specified service per demand.
  - Otherwise: prefers plans containing the specified service but allows others.
- `confirmed_services`: list of services that require reservation.

## Favorite-based User Model

- Files: `user_model/favorite/`
- Primary class: `UserManager`

This model provides richer, per-user route preferences including favorite service, walking time limits, and candidate sorting.

### Behavior

- Each user gets a `RouteFilter` instance. If a `UserType` is provided, the filter becomes a `FavoriteSortedRouteFilter` that:
  - Sorts plans by `SortType` (e.g., earliest arrival, least transfers, lowest cost).
  - Applies checks for favorite service presence and enforces a walking time cap when applicable.
- If `fixed_service` is provided in the `DEMAND`, it takes priority: plans are filtered so that the given service is included.
- Waiting and failure handling are analogous to the Simple model, including "reservation vs direct depart" and walking fallbacks.

### Configuration

```json
{
  "user_params": {
    "U001": {
      "favorite_service": "rail",
      "walking_time_limit_min": 15.0,
      "sort_type": "earliest_arrival"
    },
    "U002": {
      "favorite_service": "bus",
      "walking_time_limit_min": 10.0,
      "sort_type": "least_transfers"
    },
    "U003": null
  },
  "confirmed_services": ["taxi", "shuttle"]
}
```

- `user_params`: dictionary mapping user IDs to their preferences (`UserType` or `null`):
  - `favorite_service`: preferred mobility service (e.g., `"rail"`, `"bus"`).
  - `walking_time_limit_min`: maximum acceptable walking time in minutes.
  - `sort_type`: sorting a criterion from `jschema.query.SortType` (e.g., `"earliest_arrival"`, `"least_transfers"`, `"lowest_cost"`).
- `confirmed_services`: list of services that require reservation (same as a Simple model).
